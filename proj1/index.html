  <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
  <p>In this project we built a portion of the rasterization pipeline for triangles. Our rasterizer supports different
    types of triangles in order to conform to the SVG schema, including full-colored triangles, interpolated triangles,
    and textured triangles. We also support a variety of anti-aliasing techniques, including supersampling, pixel
    sampling, and level sampling. Our core triangle rasterizer has been optimized for speed, decreasing rendering times
    by up to 60%. The other rasterization functions have been optimized for code readability and extensibility,
    exposing an easy-to-use Triangle2D interface. We've learned many lessons while completing this project, such as the
    importance of managing floating point precision, the danger of off-by-one errors, and the benefit of writing clean
    code from the start.</p>

  <h2 align="middle">Section I: Rasterization</h2>

  <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>

  <p>In order to rasterize a triangle, we first order the points to be clockwise from point 0 to point 2, with point 0
    as the lowest (largest y-coordinate) point, doing swaps until this is the case. We then efficiently loop through
    every pixel by finding the triangle’s bounding box and checking each y-coordinate row from the center
    x-coordinate outwards: we go left from the middle until we are on the left side of the triangle and then right
    from the middle until we are on the right side of the triangle. At each pixel, we check whether its center is
    inside the triangle using the three lines test, and color the framebuffer appropriately if so. Once both left
    and right traversal is done we move onto the next y-coordinate row. Once we reach the edge of the viewing box OR
    we reach the top of the bounding box, our rasterizer finishes. Since our algorithm does not check pixels outside
    the bounding box edge (starting from the center, where we will almost certainly be close to the triangle to
    avoid checking wasted pixels), and since it stops itself whenever it reaches the wrong side of the triangle, it
    skips extra pixel checks and is much more efficient. We also improved the efficiency of our rasterization
    algorithm by factoring unneeded calculations out of loops. For instance, some calculations of the line test
    equations depend only on the y-coordinate of the pixel. These calculations can be done once per y loop instead
    of once per pixel. Other small changes improved the speed of our algorithm, such as defining variables only
    once, using for loops instead of while loops, and using a uint to store the results of the line tests as bits
    instead of using multiple variables.</p>

  <p><b>Extra Credit:</b> We tested our improved algorithm against the bounding-box algorithm when rendering the
    dragon below. Using this middle-out traversal scheme, we showed that our runtime was 32% faster, with rendering
    taking 6.857 ms for the bounding box implementation and 4.683 ms for our middle-out implementation. Our
    algorithm also performed significantly better when zoomed in, taking only 6.904 ms to render a portion of the
    dragon compared to the bounding-box’s 17.632 ms, more than twice as fast. </p>

  <h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>

  <p>Our supersampling algorithm samples <i>sample_rate</i> times at each pixel and averages the Color values at each
    subpixel into a singular Color value for the resulting pixel in the framebuffer. We did this by expanding the
    sample_buffer by<i>sqrt(sample_rate)</i> in each dimension (e.g. by 4 for a sample_rate of 16). For drawing
    points and lines, accomplished with fill_pixel, we simply filled all the subpixels corresponding to pixel with
    the given color. We also create<i>sampled_height</i> and <i>sampled_width</i> variables, corresponding to the
    height and width of the frame buffer multiplied by<i>sqrt(sample_rate)</i>. Our rasterization algorithm scales
    the triangle vertices by <i>sqrt(sample_rate)</i>to match its position in the new expanded sample_buffer and
    uses <i>sampled_height</i> and <i>sampled_width</i> in place of height and width, effectively rendering the
    triangle at a higher resolution than that of the frame buffer. The <i>resolve_to_framebuffer</i>function takes
    in this sample buffer and averages out the subpixel color values before adding the color to the framebuffer,
    effectively downscaling it to the original resolution. This allows for antialiasing, as jagged edges and
    artifacts are largely eliminated thanks to the resulting blended gradient edges that fade into the background
    color.

  <p>As seen in the above images, the tip of the red triangle is "smoothed" with an increase in the sample rate. With
    a low sample rate, the triangle passes between the middle of pixels, leaving gaps in the skinny tip. With a
    higher sample rate, the tip passes through some smaller pixels. When the higher resolution image is downscaled,
    the tip of the triangle gradually fades off.</p>

  <h3 align="middle">Part 3: Transforms</h3>

  <p>Our cubeman shows a depiction of a person jumping! Both of their arms are raised and their legs bent at the knee.
    This took four additional rotates, one for each of the limbs. The translate values for the bottom leg segments
    were also changed, as well as for the arms as a whole.</p>

  <h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>

  <p>Barycentric coordinates are a 3D coordinate system used to denote the position of points within a 2D triangle,
    where each coordinate is based on the fraction of the distance of given point from one vertex to the opposite
    side along the altitude of that vertex, and the sum of the three vertices is always equal to 1. As a result,
    points in a triangle can be expressed as a function of their distance from each vertex, allowing for color maps
    as seen in the bottom right image; each point in the equilateral triangle below has been blended between red,
    green, and blue based on its distance from the corresponding vertex, such that a point right next to the top
    vertex has the color red, but that fades lower down the triangle.</p>

  <h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>

  <p>Pixel sampling is taking a known coordinate on a framebuffer and sampling a texture/image to display its colors at
    the appropriate pixel position on the framebuffer. We used pixel sampling to implement texture mapping by taking the
    coordinates of a framebuffer triangle alongside a texture image and the coordinates of a triangle within the image,
    then converting the coordinates of each pixel in the framebuffer triangle to its respective position in the texture,
    then using either nearest-neighbor sampling or bilinear sampling to calculate the Color value of that pixel based on
    the nearest pixel coordinate(s) in the texture triangle. For nearest-neighbor sampling, we simply assigned the
    framebuffer pixel the Color value of the closest pixel in the texture map after coordinate transformations. For
    bilinear sampling, we averaged the framebuffer pixel’s color between the 4 nearest pixels (which formed a bounding
    box around the pixel) by averaging them proportionally based on the horizontal and vertical distances the pixel was
    from each side of the bounding box. In the images below, we can see that both bilinear sampling and nearest-neighbor
    sampling are similar when supersampling at a sample_rate of 16, which makes sense since the pixel averaging done
    through supersampling makes up for the lack thereof in nearest-neighbor sampling. This means the difference between
    bilinear and nearest sampling is most pronounced in the non-supersampled images on the left; as we can see, the
    bilinear image is much better blended here, with longitude and latitude lines that are less jagged (though still
    somewhat choppy) than with nearest-neighbor sampling.</p>

  </div>


  <h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>

  <p>In level sampling, different resolution images (‘mipmaps’) are prepared before rendering (starting from highest
    fidelity down to very low-resolution blended images), and a mipmap is chosen whenever sampling from the image based
    on how little resolution is needed for rendering, where this mipmap is used for the texture map. In other words,
    when very large sections of an image are projected onto very small parts of the framebuffer, less detail is
    necessary, so precomputed low-quality mipmaps of the image become very useful time and memory-saving tools for
    rendering without visibly losing fidelity. We implemented level sampling through texture mapping by computing how
    each dimension of a mapped texture was scaled onto the framebuffer, and for images scaled down, we chose mipmaps of
    correspondingly low quality and used pixel sampling methods on those mipmaps rather than the full-resolution images
    themselves.</p>

  <p>We can control speed, memory, and render quality using pixel sampling (nearest vs. bilinear), level sampling
    (mipmaps vs. full-resolution images), and sampling rate (standard sampling vs. supersampling). With pixel sampling,
    nearest-neighbor sampling takes roughly the same memory but results in lower render quality and higher speed than
    bilinear sampling, as only one textured pixel needs to be referenced per framebuffer pixel in nearest-neighbor
    sampling, versus 4 for bilinear. For sampling rates, supersampling takes much more time (more computations for each
    pixel rendered), but results in better image quality and antialiasing. For level sampling, using mipmaps takes more
    memory, but results in better speed without compromising image quality (and in fact results in reduced Moire
    patterning and antialiasing); this is more cost-effective than supersampling.</p>
